                <h2>Biography:</h2>
                 <p> Hi everyone, welcome to Joseph Trinidad world. Through middle school and first year of high school I was very lazy in the sense of not doing a sport. I wanted to chill with my friends and just have fun but then once I started to see my weight, I started to make a change within my life. That is why during my sophomore year in KIPP NYC COLLEGE PREP I decided to join the football team. </p>
                 <p>It was fun because due to my size I was first string which was great news towards me because more playing time we lose a lot of games though, but I had fun. On my senior year I join the football team again and that was a tough year because throughout that whole summer we were just doing straight conditioning which was annoying because it will be so hot outside but through that challenging work, we made history and went undefeated and won the championship. </p>
                 When covid first started I had to come home from college because now we had to go online. At first it was chill, all I did was class homework and sleep all day and then stay up all night, they will be times that due to be inside every single day I start to lose tract of time due to doing the same thing over and over again which is the definition of insanity, so that is why I took a break from school and decided to work I. Now I am back at school continuing my education. </p>

        <section id="hobbies">

            <h2>Hobbies:</h2>
            <p>I have a lot of hobbies that I like to do to kill time within my life and things that interest me, and they are working and working out, getting tattoos, playing football, playing video games, sleeping and last but least collecting cards. I like working and working out because it allows me to become more disciplined but also teaches me the value of earning what I work for as well. Tattoos have always been something that I want because it is art that explains a story within a person's life like for instance my tattoo means power of oneself which illustrates what I experience and what I went through in my life. That is why I am getting more because it will explain my life story.</p> 
            <p> Furthermore, football has always been a sport that allows me to release stress and keep myself active, but I have always been trying to improve myself which is one of the main reasons I got the tattoo in the first place is because this situation also talks about the meaning the power of oneself due to me trying to improve myself every day in the field and off the field. Another thing that interests me is playing video games because it allows me to enjoy a story that is not real which is great such as dying light, dying light 2 and last of us which are remarkable story games to play.</p>
            <p>I love sleeping, especially a long day of working hard at work and school. I need sleep to recharge myself. And finally, it is collecting cards because my dad back in the day used to collect a whole bunch of cards and now as a present, he gave me 3 boxes full of cards which means that I have something worth a lot but as of now I am still looking at things so I can add into my selection. </p>

            <h2>Working Title</h2>

            <div>
                <p>Hi everyone, today I will explain the research that I found on the Image Hover effect. This is a type of code that you will typically use in CSS but there's other code editors that you can use to actually help you like WordPress, CSS and jQuery to your advantage which will make your website pretty spot on and unique towards the user because it allows you to express yourself and reveal your personality. Using these different articles “How to create an image hover-preview effect using jQuery” by Ryan Boudreaux140, “How to Add Image Hover Effects in WordPress” by Milos Petrik and finally “Awesome CSS Image Effects That You Can Use on Your Website” by WPDT Staff. They all talk about how to use the Image Hover effect well just using different web/code editors to explain the process of how to use it. </p>

                <p>The way to use the editor jQuery and CSS this will introduce our website and make it unique with the use of the code so the Image Hover effect can take its effect on the web page is that you will need to go to the file style.CSS because in the article “How to create an image hover-preview effect using jQuery” by Ryan Boudreaux140 it says that” First, we will create a style sheet and name the file styles.CSS, then save it to a sub-directory named CSS under the web directory. These will define the body, the main class, the gallery class, h1, h2, anchor, pre, image, unordered list, and list items, and the preview id. I will describe in more detail several specific styling definitions as they apply to several of these elements below. The CSS code also includes several CSS3 stylings for box shadow and text shadow; the code contained within the style sheet is shown below: First, we will create a style sheet and name the file styles.CSS, then save it to a sub-directory named CSS under the web directory. These will define the body, the main class, the gallery class, h1, h2, anchor, pre, image, unordered list, and list items, and the preview id. I will describe in more detail several specific styling definitions as they apply to several of these elements below. The CSS code also includes several CSS3 stylings for box shadow and text shadow; the code contained within the style sheet” This illustrates the use of the proper way to use this code to implement a hover effect on the image once you get the hang of it becomes easy to do it there is just a lot of things that you need to do to make this code acceptable towards your image on the screen within your website. Using CSS editor which I'm used to it is easy because if you need help just hover on the word and it will tell you it is function and how to use it. In the article “Awesome CSS Image Effects That You Can Use on Your Website” by WPDT Staff it says that” We will start the list of CSS image hover effects with Button Hover Animation, which creates an animated outline on hover. The effect was developed by BhautikBharadavato to emphasize call-to-action buttons. It works smoothly and the code is clean, allowing for a quick loading time and easy customization.” This illustrates the use of how to make a work have a border within its area so if you decided to interreact with it, it would allow you to see a border within the word </p>
                
                <p>Furthermore, the way we use the editor WordPress is that it will Develop an approved site for yourself if you an entrepreneur, so it helps you get started. So according to the article “How to Add Image Hover Effects in WordPress” by Milos Petrik it says that” We will start with a simple post and some placeholder text. In order to add a gallery to your page, you need to drag the Image Gallery element to where you want it. Once the placeholder gallery element is set, you need to populate it with some images. In the General tab, click on the plus sign under Images to add images. You can choose images from your media library or upload them, and, when they are uploaded, make sure they are selected (marked with checkmarks), click on Create a new gallery.” This illustrates the use of how to use the editor WordPress it is easy once you follow the steps within the directions on the website. Therefore, this is what I concluded through my research of how to use the Image Hover effect hopefully this helps you with your progress on the creation of your website.</p>
