## **Description On My About Me Project**

Hello everyone, today I will introduce you to my About Me project. And in my project, we have a Bio, Gallery, Lit section and a section where you can contact me if you have a question through the use of your info. Through the use of creating all of these sections I've learned a lot about myself as well because everything that I'm learning is very new to me. Throughout starting the sections, we first have to have a base like our logo and our character. First we added an index.html file so we can start coding. Then we also save the images that depict ourselves in our About Me project. We also had to set up our netlify account so we can update our progress on a website and GitHub so we can also update all of our commits into the system. 
This is where the fun part starts which is coding, This is where the fun part starts which is doing some styling. So first for the Adding Some Style section we used link tag to copy and paste the link of the specific tag font-family which is roboto and we used the head to insert our text so it can implant the property so we can see in real time. Then after we added a folder which in the folder it’s CSS but in the file that’s where we are going to start our styling. This part was the fun part because I get to use the footer and header to style it to my choosing. I resized the element in my project so it can fit perfectly on the screen. In my Tell Me More assignment we took 3 photos that represent one of our hobbies or interests and basically style it so it can fit into every device. 
We used h2, ul and li which will allow me to make it into a list format on my website. We also included hr, and fig caption so our hobbies can have an img with wording towards what we do. The next assignment was Responsive Design which was fun for me because I get to learn the display with flex, flex-direction with column, and align-items in the center, which allowed my photo gallery to transform into a column and also I was able to align my items like my text in the middle so it can be better suited for the user. For the web forms assignment taught me how to add an contact section where you can contact me if you have any questions through the use of your name so I can know who you are, phone number, email, selection on what type of phone number your using and a text area for the person that wants to talk to me through the use of fieldset and legend. My favorite section from this project was probably the Nav Bar assignment because I’ve learn how to basically make my website interactive through the use of introducing the nav bar, but before that happening the style.css file needs to have some still in order for it to be interactive like for my website when you press one of the words the word will turn black to signify that you have the word selected. Through the use of img, h1, header, nav, navbar, header, div with logo and navbar, ul, 4 li elements, nav-links with the bio(bio) gallery(Gallery), lit(Blog) and the contact(Contact Me). These are the sections that you need to insert in your code in order for everything to work perfectly in real time.But in order for that to happen we need to put the important aspects in the VSCode which is the index.html which is the navbar.

## **The Color Scheme on My About Me Project** 

The color scheme that I used in my project for the nav.css was for the background-color i’ve used the color gray with the color whitesmoke so it can fit in with the background of the whole website so it can be easier to look at in-general. And I did the same thing for the navbar-links a which will also help out the website to be easier to look at but also due to the color once you press one of the sections it will highlight to show you that you are interacting with the website. For the style.css I've used background-color which is #F2BB66 and for the color I've used #3D4CC4 which changes the things within the body. In the #hobbies ul li:nth-child(even) I've used the color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.459); which is black to illustrate the colors towards the hobbies section.
